# Twitch Clone

This is more like boilerplate code created for the [updated version here](https://github.com/maariyadiminsky/video-streamer).

Although the project is called “twitch-clone” I was never intending to make an exact clone of Twitch—rather rather a Twitch-inspired CRUD project to learn how to setup streaming video.

This project is less focused on styles and more on functionality.
There is another version of this project with more updated code, better styling(soon). It also includes the api mock server and rtmp server needed to run everything together. 

I left this version of the project because I wanted to show it with older React syntax as well—ie. class component, React life cycles etc.

The updated version includes:
1. Code Updates: React Hooks, Tests, Context instead of Redux, Redux Final Form instead of Redux Form.
2. Mock API Server
3. RTMP server setup
4. Instructions on how to make this work on your end
5. More styles etc.
